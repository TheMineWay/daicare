# 🤝 Contributing to Daicare

We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to Daicare! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this TypeScript monorepo scaffold project.

## 🌟 Welcome Contributors!

**Everyone is welcome to fork and create pull requests!** We believe in open collaboration and appreciate all contributions, whether they're bug fixes, documentation improvements, or new features.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Daicare is designed to be a **generic, reusable scaffold** for TypeScript full-stack applications. When contributing, please keep these core principles in mind:

### ✅ What We Welcome
- **🐛 Bug fixes** - Fixing issues in existing functionality
- **📚 Documentation improvements** - Better explanations, examples, and guides
- **🧪 Test coverage** - Adding or improving tests
- **⚡ Performance improvements** - Optimizations that don't change core structure
- **🔧 Developer experience** - Tooling and workflow improvements
- **🛡️ Security enhancements** - Security fixes and improvements
- **📦 Dependency updates** - Keeping libraries up-to-date
- **✨ Generic features** - Features that benefit most scaffold users

### ❌ What We Cannot Accept
- **🏗️ Structural changes** that affect the scaffold's architecture (majors should be discussed)
- **🎨 Opinionated design decisions** that limit the scaffold's flexibility
- **🔗 Business logic** specific to particular domains or use cases
- **💼 Application-specific features** that don't serve the general scaffold purpose
- **🎛️ Breaking changes** to the established patterns and conventions

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### 🔍 Before You Start

2. **Create an issue** - Discuss your idea before implementing
3. **Review the documentation** - Understand the project structure
4. **Follow the patterns** - Stay consistent with existing code

### 📝 Code Standards
- **TypeScript** - All code must be properly typed
- **ESLint/Biome** - Follow the established linting rules
- **Testing** - Include tests for new functionality
- **Documentation** - Update docs for new features
- **Commit messages** - Use clear, descriptive commit messages

## 🎨 Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards

- Keep files **focused and cohesive**
- Use **consistent naming conventions**
