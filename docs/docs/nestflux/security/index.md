# üîê Security Overview

An introduction to security fundamentals in NestFlux applications.

## üéØ Security Philosophy

NestFlux implements a comprehensive security strategy built on industry best practices:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify approach
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems get minimum necessary access
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated from the start

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Layers

### Application Security

The NestFlux template includes several built-in security measures:

- **Helmet**: HTTP security headers to protect against common vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation using Zod schemas
- **CORS Configuration**: Controlled cross-origin resource sharing
- **Environment Isolation**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration

### Identity & Access Management

NestFlux implements modern identity management:

- **External Authentication**: Integration with OIDC providers (Authentik, Keycloak)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permission system
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure, stateless authentication tokens
- **Session Management**: Proper token lifecycle and refresh handling

### Data Protection

Data security is ensured through:

- **Database Security**: Secure database connections and query protection
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: Protected endpoints with proper validation
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## üîç Security Components

### Authentication
How users prove their identity to access the system. NestFlux uses OIDC integration with third-party providers for secure, standards-based authentication.

**Learn more**: [Authentication Documentation](./authentication.md)

### Authorization  
How the system determines what authenticated users can access. NestFlux implements RBAC with fine-grained permissions for comprehensive access control.

## üö® Common Security Considerations

### Environment Variables
- Store sensitive configuration securely
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different keys for different environments
- Rotate secrets regularly

### API Security
- Validate all input data
- Implement proper error handling
- Use HTTPS in production
- Monitor for suspicious activity

### Database Security
- Use parameterized queries (Drizzle handles this)
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security updates
- Backup and recovery procedures

*Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential for maintaining a secure application.*
