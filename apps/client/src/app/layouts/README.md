# Layouts

This directory contains reusable layout components and patterns used throughout the application. Layouts provide consistent structure and styling for different types of pages and interfaces.

## Purpose

The layouts folder is responsible for:

- **Common layout patterns**: Standardized layouts for managers, tables, forms, and other UI patterns
- **Page structure**: Consistent page organization and navigation patterns  
- **Responsive design**: Layout components that adapt to different screen sizes
- **Visual consistency**: Ensuring uniform spacing, positioning, and visual hierarchy

This ensures all management pages follow the same layout patterns and visual consistency.
